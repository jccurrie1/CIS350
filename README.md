<h1>1. Introduction</h1>

This is a group project with the goal to create a fullstack web application. Learning the software development process as we work on the project. The name of our project is Wasted. The goal of our web based application is to eliminate at home food waste. We will do this by alerting people when certain items are close to expiring. The almost automatic reminder that an item is expiring will help food waste decrease for those that use our website.
