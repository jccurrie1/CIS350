<h1>1. Abstract</h1>
An estimated 931 million tons of food goes to waste every year. This is an increasing problem as it becomes more expensive as production costs increase and space decreases. Landfills are also increasing the amount of methane gas released into the air. Most people don’t realize that this is an increasing problem. It’s hard to keep track of the life span of your food in everyday life. To combat this problem our team has created a website-“Wasted” to help the average person combat food waste. The user will be able to make an account and type what food they have in their fridge. Our website will then notify them when their food is about to go bad. This will help the average person combat food waste while also saving them money.

<h1>2. Introduction</h1>
 
 A website is a group of related webpages located under a single domain name, typically produced by a single person or organization. Food waste is becoming an increasing problem that not many people know about. Food waste is increasing at an alarming rate which is costing everyone money while also destroying the environment. A simple website could be the key to solving this epidemic. With this website the  average person can help combat the food waste epidemic while also saving themselves money. This website-“Wasted” is expected to provide a simple and efficient way to track your food’s average life span. Once the user goes into the website they will be asked to register. After the user registers, they will be able to login into their homepage. There the user will be able to input the food they have at home. “Wasted” will then calculate the expected life span of your food. “Wasted” will alert the user when their food is about to expire.
